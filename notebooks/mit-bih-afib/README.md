This folder contains notebooks and scripts used with the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database.  
`MIT-BIH-AFIB-05-xfr-learn.ipynb` is the notebook used to modify, train and test the deep CNN model using transfer learning.  
`MIT-BIH-AFIB-06-tflite.ipynb` is the notebook used to create TensorFlow Lite models from the deep CNN model.  

Disclaimer: Since this is a personal research project and not intended for production, I did not spend a lot of time designing files and functions for long term maintenance.  As a result, documentation is light, naming conventions are weak, error handling is minimal, structure may be confusing, and some files are duplicated across multiple source directories.
