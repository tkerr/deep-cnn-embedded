This folder contains notebooks and scripts used with the Icentia11k Single Lead Continuous Raw Electrocardiogram Dataset.  
Most notebooks in this folder are used to identify, organize and download rhythm sequences from the dataset.  
`inception_model.py` contains functions for building the deep CNN model.  
`Icentia11k-07-inception.ipynb` is the notebook used to build, train and test the deep CNN model.  

Disclaimer: Since this is a personal research project and not intended for production, I did not spend a lot of time designing files and functions for long term maintenance.  As a result, documentation is light, naming conventions are weak, error handling is minimal, structure may be confusing, and some files are duplicated across multiple source directories.
